## My process
Started with mobile first workflow. Created basic HTML structure, then mobile css, then desktop css, then finally I added the JavaSrcipt.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile first workflow.

### What I learned

I learned about positioning and z-index.
```css
.mobile {
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 10;
}
```

I also learned more about how a website is structured and learned how to create a dropdown menu.

### Continued development

Moving forward I would like more practice with JavaScript and creating more complex website concepts.
